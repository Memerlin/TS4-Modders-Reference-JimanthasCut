Right now, there are two main ways to contribute to The Sims 4 Modders Reference.

Both ways need to follow the **[Contribution Guidelines](../contribution-guidelines)**.

## Through GitHub

Please create your own fork of **[The Sims 4 Modders Reference Github Repository](https://github.com/Llama-Logic/TS4-Modders-Reference)**, and commit all of your changes before making a Pull Request. Be as descriptive as you can with the names and descriptions of your commits, and test these changes *before* submitting a PR.

If you don't know how to do any of this, but would like to give it a shot, feel free to review this **[How to Use GitHub](../github-and-writing-tutorial)** tutorial.

<!--Jimantha on August 22th, 2025: I'm confused as to why simply doing "github-and-writing-tutorial" made astro try to look inside the "about/how-to-contribute" folder. Said folder doesn't exist, it seems to think this file is a folder. This is why we always have to go one folder above when making relative links.-->

## Through Other Means

After you've written your tutorial (if you want to write directly for the site), or you've decided which of your own tutorials you want to add to this site, please contact amethyst lilac or Jimantha (both on Discord) with your documents or links.

As stated in the **[Contribution Guidelines](../contribution-guidelines)**, you can chose to be credited or remain anonymous.
