This page documents the String Table (STBL) format.

The format is a key-value store used to store all the game strings.

## Format Specification

```js

- Little Endian

== FILE ==
HEADER               file metadata
ENTRY[string count]  key-string entries with metadata

== HEADER ==
byte[4] = "STBL"  file identifier
uint16  = 5       format version
byte    = 0       compressed (unused by Maxis and modders)
unit64            string count
byte[2]           unknown/unused
uint32            total string size if null terminated

== ENTRY ==
